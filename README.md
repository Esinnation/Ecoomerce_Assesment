This project uses Vite for a fast and efficient development experience. Here's how to set up and run your project:

Prerequisites:

Node.js (version 14.18.0 or above): https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
Installation:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git

Install dependencies:
Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

npm install

Running the Development Server:

Start the development server:

npm run dev

This will start the server on http://localhost:3000/ by default. You can access your application in the browser at this URL.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

Vite offers Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which automatically updates the browser when you make changes to your code. This allows for a seamless development experience without the need to manually refresh the page.

Building for Production:

Build your project for production with:

npm run build
This will create an optimized production build in the dist folder. You can then deploy this folder to your web server.

Additional Notes:

You can customize the development server port and other options by editing the vite.config.js file.
Vite supports various frameworks and libraries. Refer to the official documentation for more information: https://vitejs.dev/
This is a basic setup guide. Feel free to explore Vite's features and adjust the instructions to fit your specific project needs.
